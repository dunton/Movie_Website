# Movie Website Project

This is a website of six movie posters. When one of the movie posters is 
clicked on the trailer for that movie will play in the browser. 

### Set-Up
Download the zip file titled **Dunton_Movie_Project**. 

The zipped file should contain four files:

* **fresh_tomatoes**
* **media**
* **entertainment_center**
* **README**


Make sure to have a text editor installed capable of reading **python**
code (ie. Sublime, Atom, Text Wrangler, etc) as well as a web browser
installed (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc).

Make sure **fresh_tomatoes**, media.py and **entertainment_center**
are saved in the same folder. 

The file **entertainment_center** will import the files **media** and **fresh_tomatoes**.

### Opening the Website
Run the file **entertainment_center**.
